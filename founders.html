							<p>Why I Started Topology Computing</p>
							<p>The idea for Topology Computing was born out of a desire to bridge the gap between advanced technology and real-world business challenges. I noticed that many companies struggled to integrate sophisticated solutions like AI, machine learning, and data engineering into their operations. This inspired me to create a consultancy that not only provides these technologies but also ensures they are tailored to meet the unique needs of each client. I love being able to see companies harness the tools that are available to us in this day and age. We live in a new era of technology that is more accessible and affordable than many think. My goal is to help those scale out these tools and see them help change lives for those who never thought they could use such technologies.</p>
